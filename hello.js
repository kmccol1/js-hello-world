/*  
Welcome, new coder. 
Enter your code on line 7 to print 'Hello, World!' 
to the console (the panel on the right)
*/

console.log("Hello, World!");

/*  
Next, PLAY! 
Modify your code on line 7 to try to accomplish the tasks listed below:

   1. Change the message that is printed.
      console.log("Hello to the World!");
   2. Figure out what the parentheses do. Will the code work without them?
      console.log"Hello to the World!";
   3. Remove one or both quotation marks. Do we need to include both opening and closing quote marks? Is there a difference between using a single or a double quote (' vs. ")?
       console.log('Hello to the World!');
   4. Remove the semi-colon, ;.
      console.log("Hello to the World!")
   5. Print a number. (Bonus: Print two numbers added together).
      console.log(4);
      console.log(8+8);
   6. Print multiple messages one after the other.
       console.log("Hello to the World!");
       console.log("World!");
   7. Print two messages on the same line.
       console.log("Hello", "World!");
   8. Print a message that contains quote marks, such as Quoth the Raven "Nevermore".
       console.log('Quoth the Raven "Nevermore"');
   9. Other. You choose!
       console.log('"The world is quiet here."');
